Overview
========

ARMboot is a firmware monitor/bootloader for embedded systems based 
on ARM or StrongARM CPUs. The primary objectives for this software is 
to be easily portable to new platforms while being as powerful as possible.
To date it is the only GPL'ed ARM firmware capable of supporting multiple
types of flash memory, network download via bootp, dhcp, tftp, PCMCIA CF
booting and more.

ARMboot is heavily based on the sister project PPCboot. It is planned, to
move both projects even close together to increase their robustness and 
mutual benefit.


Getting ARMboot
===============

ARMboot is hosted on Sourceforge:

    http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/armboot

The lastest version can always be obtained via the anonymous CVS access of
Sourceforge. Tarballs are released sporadically, and can be downloaded from
the same site.


Mailing List
============

Questions regarding the use and porting of ARMboot should be posted to the
ARMboot mailing list. You can subscibe here:

    http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/armboot-users/

If you want to get help on a certin issue, please go first to the 
mailing list's archive to whether that question has been discussed in the
past. 


Building ARMboot
================

To configure and build ARMboot you will need a GNU cross development
tool-chain configured for arm-linux. You should NOT need any linux header
files. If so, please report this on the mailing list. 

The cross development tools usually have a target specific prefix. For
instance, your cross compiler may be called "arm-linux-gcc" or
"arm_armv4-gcc". This prefix can be passed to the Makefile by setting the
CROSS_COMPILE variable, which defaults to "arm-linux-".

The following example is for the "LART" board:

1. Configure

    sh# make lart_config
    rm -f include/config.h include/config.mk
    Configuring for lart Board...

2. Build

    sh# make all
    ...
    arm_armv4-objcopy  -O srec armboot armboot.srec
    arm_armv4-objcopy  -O binary armboot armboot.bin
